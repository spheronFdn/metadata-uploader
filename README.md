## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

You'll also need a Spheron authentication token. You can obtain this token by signing up on the [Spheron website](https://spheron.network/) and generating an API key.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spheron-storage-example.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
Copy code
cd spheron-storage-example
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
npm install
```

3. Open the index.js file and replace the token variable with your Spheron authentication token.

## Usage
To run the example code, execute the following command:

```bash
Copy code
node index.js
```
This command will upload a sample JSON file to IPFS using the Spheron Storage SDK, fetch it, and display the uploaded data in the console.
